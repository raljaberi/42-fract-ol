# fract-ol  

**fract-ol** is a 42 project focused on generating and visualizing fractals using the MiniLibX graphics library. It explores complex mathematical calculations to render fractals such as the Mandelbrot and Julia sets, allowing for interactive zooming and color variations. This project enhances understanding of mathematical functions, graphical rendering, and event-driven programming.
